# Pizza Sales Project

## Overview

The Pizza Sales Project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization project focused on examining sales data from a fictional pizza restaurant chain. This project combines SQL for data extraction and transformation, Python for data cleaning, and Power BI for data visualization. The main objective is to provide actionable insights to assist the pizza restaurant chain in optimizing operations, enhancing sales, and improving customer satisfaction.

## Project Components

### 1. Data Acquisition

The project begins with acquiring raw sales data from various sources such as databases, CSV files, or other data storage systems. This data typically includes details like customer orders, product information, order dates, and transaction amounts.

### 2. Data Cleaning with Python

Python is utilized for data cleaning tasks, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data into a consistent format. This step ensures that the data is ready for further analysis and visualization.

### 3. Data Transformation with SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is employed to further clean, filter, and transform the prepared data into a format suitable for analysis. Tasks may involve joining tables, aggregating data, and creating calculated fields.

### 4. Data Analysis

Once the data is prepared and transformed, various SQL queries are written to conduct in-depth data analysis. This includes identifying top-selling pizza flavors, analyzing sales trends, evaluating customer demographics, and calculating key performance indicators (KPIs).

### 5. Power BI Visualization

Power BI is leveraged to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards and reports that showcase the insights gained from the data analysis. Visualizations may include bar charts, line charts, maps, and KPI cards, providing stakeholders with actionable insights at a glance.

### 6. Insights and Recommendations

Based on the analysis and visualizations, actionable insights and recommendations are derived to help the pizza restaurant chain make informed decisions. These insights can aid in refining marketing strategies, optimizing menu offerings, and improving overall business performance.

## Dependencies

- SQL database or data source
- Python for data cleaning
- Power BI Desktop

By integrating Python for data cleaning into the project workflow, we ensure that the data is thoroughly prepared before being analyzed and visualized in Power BI. This holistic approach enables us to derive meaningful insights and drive business growth effectively.
